			<p>Happy Quarantine 28th Birthday!</p>
			<p>I would do anything to be able to celebrate your birthday with cheese, wine, cake, and hugs—just put those on hold for a little bit; you know we are good for it. Even without being able to share those things right now, you deserve to have the best day and to know how much we love you. Not only are you a kind, caring, and loving aunt and a thoughtful and supportive sister-in-law, you are a dedicated friend and an incredibly motivated and hard worker.  You don’t half ass anything and you always strive to be better at life.  You are doing an amazing job and we can’t wait to see what this next year brings for you. Hopefully it includes lots more time together and a lot less global pandemic.  But either way, we know you’ll thrive because that’s just what you do. We miss you so much and Evan can’t wait to giggle with you soon. HBD Kayla. Love you.</p>
