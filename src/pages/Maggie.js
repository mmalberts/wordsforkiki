			<p>My dear sweet beloved Kayla,</p>
			<p>On this the 28th anniversary of your birth, I am so happy to be able to celebrate you with some words of affirmation that you can read today and any other time when you need them. Talking you up is one of my all-time favorite hobbies because you are one of my all-time favorite people to exist.</p>
			<p>It's so hard to believe that our friendship started on a random weekday at the beginning of our sophomore year of college, when you came up behind me in the ADPi dining room and gave me a big hug for no reason. I remember it so vividly. I had spent every day of college up until that point struggling to keep my head above water, feeling as though nobody on the planet really knew me, or even cared to. How angsty, right? But that simple, sweet gesture that you don't even remember doing felt like the tenderest thing in the world to me. That was the first time you made my life brighter, and you've done it a thousand times since.</p>
			<p>Since then, we've shared several homes and SO MUCH LIFE together. I am infinitely thankful to have had you by my side through every weird twist and turn life has taken. You've made every hard thing more bearable with your unwavering love and patience, and you take every opportunity to thoroughly (and I mean THOROUGHLY) celebrate the good things. You're always ready with a hug or a laugh or a drink or a scream into the void when it's needed most.</p>
			<p>The most amazing thing about you is that you make everyone else in your life feel just as loved and seen as I feel. How is it possible that you have such a capacity to care for the people around you?! Even in your professional life, you empathize so strongly with the people you work with, and you work to the point of exhaustion to make their lives better. Just reading snippets of the other letters people have written you has confirmed what I already knew to be true: every single person you meet is happier because they know you. I can't believe how fortunate I am to call you my best friend and to get to do life with you forever (just try to get rid of me I dare you).</p>
			<p>Happy, happy birthday, Kiki! I hope this year brings you more joy, more peace, and more opportunities to show off those killer dance moves. And most importantly, I hope you feel how loved and important you are to everyone in your life every single day. It's such an honor to celebrate you. I love you SO MUCH!</p>
			<p>Love,</p>
			<p>Maggie</p>
