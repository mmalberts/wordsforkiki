			<p>Kayla,</p>
			<p>Happy 28th birthday, love! I wish I could be there in person to celebrate YOU because there is just so much to celebrate about everything you are. You are truly my soulmate and I am so lucky to be your best friend.</p>
			<p>You’re the most loyal person I know. You’ve stuck by my side since elementary school and you never waver. We’ve seen each other through so much, the good and bad...terrible hairstyles (see: big n’ thicks), first crushes and boyfriends (Ben Lindamen should BE so lucky), many, MANY drunken college nights, the true struggle of adulthood, and so much more. You’ve been right there with me and I am so lucky to have experienced it all with you.. I never have to wonder if you’re on my side, you’re always right there supporting me no matter what. That kind of friendship is so rare and I am so blessed to be loved by you.</p>
			<p>You are the fun and joy in every room you’re in. Never has anyone made me laugh like you. You’re so effortlessly funny that I am often filled with jealousy and laughter at the same time. No one can fill a room with belly-laughs as quickly as you. That is such a special gift - to bring so much happiness to those around you. Few people can turn my day around like you. When I’m feeling sad or anxious you’re my first call because I know that you can simultaneously empathize and understand my sadness AND make me laugh until my sides hurt. Thank you for always bringing joy into my days.</p>
			<p>You are the strongest person I’ll ever meet. You’ve survived something so many could not, and you’re thriving despite it all. You are independent and reliable. You are intelligent and selfless. You take care of everyone in your life without asking for anything in return. I am so in awe of all you’ve accomplished on your own. It’s not my place to say this, but I know your dad is so proud of who you are.</p>
			<p>I love you so much Kayla Marie. I am so lucky to be your friend. I could spend hours gushing about you to everyone I know. I hope you see how special you are to me and to everyone in your life. I wouldn’t be the person I am today without your friendship. You’ve shaped my life in a beautiful way and I’ll forever be by your side.</p>
			<p>Happy birthday, best friend,</p>
			<p>Cavin</p>
