			<p>Happy birthday to my dearest friend, Kayla!</p>
			<p>We have truly been through every little detail of life together—and birthdays are the very best reminder of that.</p>
			<p>I’ve had the gift of celebrating you for most of our lives. And, today, I am celebrating the vibrance you bring to my life, and everyone else you meet.</p>
			<p>Kayla, you truly live your life in color. Laughing with you is absolute sunshine. Your loyalty is the deepest shade of purple. Your passion for life and others is fire. When you are there, the rest of us are brighter.</p>
			<p>Your light is contagious. Never quiet your light. May it burn its brightest in year twenty eight.</p>
			<p>I love you!</p>
