			<p>Kiki,</p>
			<p>Happy 28th trip around the sun BGK! Can you believe we’ve been friends for like 15 years?! It feels like just yesterday we were bowling and synchronized swimming together. Once quarantine is over you better come to KC and we can synchronize swim again. I feel so lucky and blessed that you are in my life. You are such a loyal, smart and fun loving person that truly brightens my days. I’m so glad that I can come to you with any problem and you are there with support and advice.  I know you are my ride or die for life. If I ever murdered someone I legit know you would be right by my side to bury the body.</p>
			<p>I would give anything to be in Chicago to celebrate today. I can’t wait to be reunited and I’ll even let you hug me. Make sure Emmanuel makes you a good dinner and drink for your special day.</p>
			<p>Love you long time!!!</p>
			<p>Molly</p>
