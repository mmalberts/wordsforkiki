			<p>Dear Kayla,</p>
			<p>First of all, happy happy birthday to you, sweet angel! I admire  you so much—you bring so much joy and light to my life even now that I’m so far away! You have this incredible spirit and humor that is infectious and inviting. I watch you move through the world befriending so many people and making a difference in so many people’s lives and it inspires me. I know the world is a weird place right now—and always, to be honest—but know that all of your friends are thinking of you today! I hope you spend the day lavished with love, good food and all of the good things.</p>
			<p>I cannot wait until I can see your sweet sweet face again in person!</p>
			<p>Love you Kaylita.</p>
			<p>Liaht</p>
