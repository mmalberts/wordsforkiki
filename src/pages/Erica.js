			<p>Happy Birthday, Sissy!  I love you so much and wish I could celebrate with you today in person!  You are my forever best friend, definitely my favorite sister and a true role model.  You are so loved by so many people and I hope today you feel that more than ever!  I have so many happy memories with you by my side.  From blanket forts in the backseat of the van on our way to Wisconsin each summer, sleepovers at Anna's house, and you yelling at me to blot up the blood in the hallway with ice cubes after you butchered your leg trying to shave for one of the first times.  You have always been there from me and my true support system. I love having you as my sissy and can't wait to have you as my Maid of Honor!  Enjoy your day today, feel the love, and pump up the festivities.  I am celebrating you from Iowa and we will celebrate together in person soon.  I love you so much!!!</p>
			<p>Xoxo, Erica</p>
