			<p>My dearest Kayla,</p>
			<p>Happy birthday, angel from above! I am so, so sad we can’t be together on your day. I would give anything to have another Logan boulevard birthday picnic with you, with so much cheese and at least one baguette per person, per the Alberts family rule. I believe that’s the same rule for bottles of rosé. In fact, if given the option to sleep in alley man’s garage corner for one night in exchange for giving you a birthday smack on the butt and delivering a Mariano’s fruit tart to you, I would gladly accept, and bring cheese for my rat friends. I would cut off my left pinky toe (honestly, gladly, these feet are looking like total garbage RN it’d be one less thing to worry about) if it meant I could sprint-walk down the street with you, talking way too loudly, about some idiot at work that pissed us off that day.</p>
			<p>I hope that even though your birthday will be much more quiet than it usually is, you take some time to yourself and Emmanuel to celebrate and not give a flying hoot about anything else! I recommend a bubble bath with lots of wine, possibly while you read these letters and Emmanuel bakes an oven pizza for you, with pizza rolls as an appetizer. Can you take Wednesday off? You deserve to be extra spoiled and also to not have to answer (*to be read in the screeching voice) one DAMN EMAIL AMIRIGHT?!</p>
			<p>Having a birthday during quarantine must be pretty difficult, especially for a social butterfly. I keep thinking that ‘when all of this is over’ we’ll have a proper celebration, but maybe we can just try to make some positive memories out of this time, too. I don’t mean zoom meets necessarily, but little things. You’ll probably never forget getting all of these letters from the people you love on this weird birthday, telling you how much they love you.</p>
			<p>And wow, do we absolutely love the shit out of you. You make everyone’s lives so bright and full of warmth. You make me laugh so hard because you are straight up bananas in the most original, Kayla way. Everyone that knows you and is lucky enough to share a friendship with you knows that they always have someone in their corner. You make people feel like they have their own personal fan club, and you, Kayla, are the president of each one.  Your heart is so big, and knowing the right thing to do, for yourself and for others, has always come naturally to you. You are so unique and special, I wouldn’t change one damn thing about you. Thank you for teaching me to be myself, and to be forgiving and patient when that self is not someone I like. You have taught me so much about loving others.</p>
			<p>I hope your birthday is special in a new way. Know that when we’re allowed to touch each other again, I am running into your arms so fast. Happy birthday sweet Kale!</p>
			<p>Love,</p>
			<p>Chloe</p>
